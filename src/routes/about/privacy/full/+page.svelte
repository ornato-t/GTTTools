<p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>

    changes to such personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Information automatically collected</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser
        and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>
<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not
    reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information,
    such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
    device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical
    information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for
    our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes:</p>
<ul>

        <p><em>Log and Usage Data.</em> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance
            information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log
            files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information,
            browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps
            associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which
            features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called

    <li>
        <p><em>Location Data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device&#39;s location, which
            can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the
            device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
            geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing
            us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
            setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
            Services.</p>

    </li>
</ul>
<p id="legalbases"><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have
        a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with
        laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights,
        or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in
    order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
    personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to

    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
            necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests
            and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
            purposes described in order to:</p>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
            compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
            agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
            we are involved. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect
        your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
        the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>
<p>In legal terms, we are generally the &#39;data controller&#39; under European data protection laws of the personal

    perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a &#39;data processor&#39; on
    behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered
    into a data processing agreement is the &#39;data controller&#39; responsible for your personal information, and we
    merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about
    our customers&#39; privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to
    them.</p>

        and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
<p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with
    third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ( &#39;<strong>third parties</strong>&#39; ) who
    perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts
    in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that
    they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not
    share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They also commit to pr otect the data they hold
    on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

        business to another company.</li>
</ul>
<p id="cookies"><strong>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
        information.</em></p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you
    interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services ,
    prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics
    and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or
    to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and
    service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests
    which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
    Cookie Notice .</p>
<p id="inforetain"><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
        outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
    requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p id="infosafe"><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the
    security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
    100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties
    will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing
